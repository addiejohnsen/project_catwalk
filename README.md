# Project Catwalk

## Overview
Thread Lightly was a front-end capstone project for [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/) Austin's 56 cohort (Project Catwalk). The team of three engineers was tasked to overhaul and modernize an outdated client-facing retail web-portal that has been hurting the clients sales. All work had to be intergrated with the existing backend. The team was provided an extensive Business Requirements Document, which outlined the scope, the required functionality, and the desired wireframe to adhere to. Each engineer focused on an individual component of the application, working from a shared codebase. I focused on building thee Questions & Answers widget.
